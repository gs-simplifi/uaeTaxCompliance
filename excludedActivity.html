<h1>Excluded activities</h1>
<h3>Regardless of whether income is derived from FZ or non-FZ persons, such income would be disqualified from FZ relief where it is derived from excluded activities. According to MD139, this includes:</h3>

<ol>
    <li>any transactions with natural persons, except transactions in relation to the qualifying activities specified under points (4), (6), (7) and (10) above;</li>
    <li>banking activities that are subject to the regulatory oversight of the competent authority in the state;</li>
    <li>insurance activities that are subject to the regulatory oversight of the competent authority in the state, other than the activity specified under point (5) of the qualifying activities listed;</li>
    <li>finance and leasing activities that are subject to the regulatory oversight of the competent authority in the state, other than those specified under points (9) and (10) of the qualifying activities listed;</li>
    <li>ownership or exploitation of immovable property, other than commercial property located in a FZ where the transaction in respect of such commercial property is conducted with other FZ persons;</li>
    <li>ownership or exploitation of intellectual property assets;</li>
    <li>any activities that are ancillary to the activities listed above.</li>
</ol>


<h4>The FZ relief would therefore typically not cover transactions with natural persons, nor would it apply to most immovable property transactions (aside from commercial property transactions with other FZ persons).</h4>
<h3>It is anticipated that the Ministry may release further guidance on the ambit of each of these categories in due course.</h3>
